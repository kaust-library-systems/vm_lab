# VM Lab

Creating and managing a test environment with virtual machines (VMs). The machines are created and provisioned using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), and for the configuration we will use [Anbible](https://www.ansible.com/).

## Vagrant

The operating system used for this laboratory is [Debian Bookworm 64 bit](https://www.debian.org/), because it's similar, but much lighter than Ubuntu.

## Ansible
